# Python Recruitment Control System

Project Name: Recruitment Control System

Used Technologies: Python Flask, MSSQL server, PyCharm, HTML, Basic Bootstrap,

The aim of this project is to to combine employers with job applicants in a system. 
Job Applicants enter their resume information and the position they want to apply. 
While employers enter the positions (open vacancies) they open for applicants.
For now the insert, update, delete and get methods are developed and with basic html files are used.

In the next step I will develop a method for the Employers such that there will be an email sending button. 
In the RecruitmentCSManagement.py button will be a function running to send emails for the suitable Applicants.
There are conditions both for Employers and Applicants to be suitable for each other. 
And these are "Position" and "City". 
There will be a general chart for both Employers and Applicants separately.

In this web project Python Flask and MSSQL server is used.
